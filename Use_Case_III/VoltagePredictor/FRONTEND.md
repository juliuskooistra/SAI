# Generating the Front End
From the API you've created, download the OpenAPI spec document at the /docs endpoint.

## Initial prompt
I have a machine learning model that predicts the peak voltage on the net given some energy network specifics and information about the number of solar panels. I want to monetize this ML model and have already created an API with the attached spec. I want you to create a full web based app that allows users to login and query this API. I am setting up authentication system but don't worry about that yet. Can you create this web app for me?


# Running the thing

```
cd VoltagePredictor

pnpm install
```
